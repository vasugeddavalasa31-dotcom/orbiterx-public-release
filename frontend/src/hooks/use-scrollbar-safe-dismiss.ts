/**
 * Keeps a Radix `DismissableLayer` surface (Popover / DropdownMenu content) open
 * while the user drags a scrollbar inside it. On WKWebView (not Chromium) this
 * otherwise dismisses the layer the instant the scrollbar is grabbed. The real
 * mechanism — confirmed by tracing live events in the actual WebView — is a
 * FOCUS bounce, not a pointer quirk:
 *
 *   pointerdown on `.os-scrollbar-handle` (inside the popover)
 *     → the popover's focused element blurs
 *     → WebKit immediately moves focus to the nearest `contenteditable` OUTSIDE
 *       the popover (here the Tiptap message composer)
 *     → Radix `useFocusOutside` sees a `focusin` on that outside element and
 *       dismisses.
 *
 * The pointer path is already safe: because the scrollbar is a real DOM node the
 * content `contains()` (an OverlayScrollbars bar, not a native one), Radix reads
 * the pointer-down as inside and never fires `pointerDownOutside`. So the fix is
 * entirely about the focus bounce.
 *
 * The distinguishing signal is NOT where focus landed (WebKit can bounce it
 * anywhere) but where the pointer interaction that caused it BEGAN. A scrollbar
 * drag starts with a `pointerdown` inside the content and is still held when the
 * spurious `focusin` fires; a genuine dismiss starts with a `pointerdown`
 * outside. So we track the originating pointer-down (a document capture listener)
 * and suppress a focus-outside whenever the in-flight — or just-ended — pointer
 * interaction started inside the content. This mirrors Radix's own
 * `hasPointerDownOutsideRef` guard, inverted for the inside case.
 *
 * Two smaller focus-outside shapes are also suppressed for good measure: focus
 * dropping to the document root, and focus bouncing back inside the content.
 * A genuine focus move to an outside element, with no inside pointer interaction
 * behind it, still dismisses as usual.
 *
 * Wire `contentRef` to the content and pass BOTH handlers to it.
